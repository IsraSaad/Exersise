                        I’m thankful that I studied art at Gordon, where disciplines mingle. Looking back, I realize how rare and wonderful<br> 
                        it was to study painting while taking classes in literature and psychology, or to gather around the dinner table with<br>
                         friends studying business, nutrition and medieval history. My years at Gordon and my semester abroadin Orvieto, Italy, <br>
                          gifted me with close-knit creative communities, but the wider community of Gordon kept me both grounded and engaged.

                        Outside of your painting concentration requirements, you may choose to pursue an internship at a local gallery, museum or studio. In the past, students have gained professional experience at places like Cape Ann Art Haven or the Studio of Makoto Fujimura in Dillon Gallery. Our monthly Professional Artist Workshop Series gives you a chance to interact with art-industry professionals on subjects like portfolio creation, marketing, business planning and networking.

                        GLOBAL OPPORTUNITIES
                        Gordon’s signature program in the ancient Umbrian countryside draws students from a range of majors and other colleges:

                        Gordon IN Orvieto (Italy)
                        RELATED PROGRAMS
                         embrace the liberal arts vision—studying the humanities and sciences and theology alongside art to broaden your vision. To that end, you are encouraged to draw inspiration from a second major or minor. Common pairs for the painting concentration include psychology, sociology, public history and museum studies, and business administration.
